    <h1>CHAR SIU (CHINESE BBQ PORK)</h1>
    <img src="../images/charsiu-1.jpg" alt="A picture of Char Siu on rice dish">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><em><strong>Char siu (叉烧) </strong></em> is a famous type of Cantonese roast meat.
        <em>Char siu</em> is its Cantonese name, but in Mandarin, it is known as <em>cha shao</em>. 
        To make char siu, pork is marinated in a sweet BBQ sauce and then roasted.
        You can find this delicious dish not only in China but also around the world.
    </p>
    <p>A good char siu recipe has depth of flavor––a salty/sweet contrast with a hint of spice 
        that compliments the pork and allows it to stand alone with just a simple mound of <em>steamed rice</em> and <em>blanched choy sum</em>.
        This recipe will help you to make this dish from scratch!
    </p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <img src="../images/charsiu-2.jpg"
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds boneless pork shoulder/pork butt</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon five spice powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons molasses</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon red food coloring <em>(optional)</em></li>
        <li>3 cloves finely minced garlic </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maltose or honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the pork into <em>long strips</em> or <em>chunks</em> about <em>2 to 3 inches thick</em>. 
            Don’t trim any excess fat, as it will render off and add flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, 
            wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses, food coloring (if using), 
            and garlic in a bowl to make the marinade (i.e. the BBQ sauce).
        </li>
        <li>
            Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade and set it aside. 
            Rub the pork with the rest of the marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. 
            Cover and store the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 'bake' at 475 F (246 C) with a rack positioned in the upper third of the oven. 
            (If you only have a convection oven, keep in mind the oven not only heats more quickly, your char siu will roast faster than what we have described here).
            Regardless, be sure to check your char siu every 10 minutes, reducing or increasing the temperature as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. 
            Using the metal rack keeps the pork off of the pan and allows it to roast more evenly, 
            like it does in commercial ovens described above. 
            Place the pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. 
            Pour 1 ½ cups water into the pan below the rack. 
            This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the pork to your preheated oven. 
            Roast for <em>25 minutes</em>, keeping the oven setting at 475 F for the first 10 minutes of roasting, and then reduce your oven temperature to 375 F (190 C).
            After 25 minutes, flip the pork. 
            If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water. 
            Turn the pan 180 degrees to ensure even roasting. 
            Roast another <em>15 minutes</em>. Throughout the roasting time, 
            check your char siu often (every 10 minutes) and reduce the oven temperature if it looks like it is burning! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the maltose or honey (maltose is very viscous––
            you can heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and 1 tablespoon hot water. 
            This will be the sauce you’ll use for basting the pork.
        </li>
        <li>
            After <em>40 minutes</em> of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and baste the other side as well. 
            Roast for a final <em>10 minutes</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            By now, the pork has cooked for <em>50 minutes</em> total. 
            It should be cooked through and caramelized on top. 
            If it’s not caramelized to your liking, 
            you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the outside and add some color/flavor. 
            Be sure <em>not</em>  to walk away during this process, since the sweet char siu BBQ sauce can burn if left unattended. 
            You can also use a meat thermometer to check if the internal temperature of the pork has reached 160 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved BBQ sauce. 
            Let the meat rest for <em>10 minutes</em>  before slicing.
        </li>
    </ol>
