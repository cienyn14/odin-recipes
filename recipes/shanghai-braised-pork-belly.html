    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Blanch the pork belly.</strong> 
            Add the pork belly and 3 slices of ginger to a pot with enough cold water to submerge the pork belly. 
            Close to lid and bring it to a boil. 
            Once the pot boils, turn down the heat and simmer for <em>one minute</em>.
            Drain, rinse the pork belly clean, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Caramelize the pork belly.</strong> 
            Add the oil and rock sugar (or 3 tablespoons regular sugar) to a low heat wok.
            Slowly melt the sugar, taking care to not let it burn.
            Then add the pork belly, 3 slices ginger, and the white parts of the scallions.
            Turn up the heat to medium while stiring to coat the pork belly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create the signature taste of soy sauce.</strong>
            Add Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, cinnamon, star anise, bay leaves, dried chili peppers, and water. 
            Stir and make sure everything is submerged.
            Bring the mixture up to a simmer over medium low heat for <em>1 hour</em>. 
            Check the pork periodically to make sure the sauce doesn’t dry up.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the sauce for the dish.</strong>
            Once the pork is to your liking in terms of tenderness, turn up the heat to cook off any excess sauce, stirring constantly. 
            The sauce will reduce to a glistening coating on the pork belly. 
            Last, add ½ teaspoon sugar and the green parts of the scallions. 
            Stir quickly and serve!
